# Zoovu Game
A game to rebuild pieces as fast as the user can but without making many mistakes. this game is made mainly with the VueJS framework.
Pieces placed in the wrong order will increment the clock time.
## Motivation
A challenge to demostrate my skills.
## Code style
Variable and function names written as camelCase. <br/>
The name of some classes are made with the BEM methodology.
## Highlights
Added some animations. <br/>
A little validation was added to prevent spaces and name with many characters. <br/>
The background and the little clock was made with pure CSS.
